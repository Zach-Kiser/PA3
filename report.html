    Our project lets you search for a Marvel character using the search bar to get information about them and comics they were in.

    You can click on comics they were in to search for similar movies you might like.

    Ex. Searching for Thanos will show the Infinity War comic, and clicking on it will show the movie Avengers Infinity War.

    You can filter results by typing 'movie' or 'series' in the input before searching for the result.

    (Created using Marvel API and Omdb movie database api).
